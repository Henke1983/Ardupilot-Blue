2022-07-05 - Starting to setup a new Beaglebone Blue with Ardupilot 

IÂ´m having this repo as "https://github.com/imfatant/test" baseplate

1a) Downloaded the image from 2022-07-01, the bone-debian-10.12-console-armhf-2022-07-01-1gb.img.xz (that didnt work) 
1b) Downloaded this image instead, https://debian.beagleboard.org/images/bone-debian-10.3-console-armhf-2020-04-06-1gb.img.xz
2. Downloaded etcher and flashed the image on the microSD card
3. Put in the microSD in the BBB and connect it with a microUSB 
4. Started putty and connect to it through 192.168.7.2 with password: temppwd
